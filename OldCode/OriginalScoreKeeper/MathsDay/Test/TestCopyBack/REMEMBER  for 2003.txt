Don't forget to take Cootamundra out of the 2002 contest.

Remember they didn't turn up as they broke down and a substitute team was put in their place to make the numbers even for the Swiss contest.

Cootamundra should be taken out of the DB so they don't update the Master DB with a new Z score in 2003 + all other Z scores will be affected.

********   REMEMBER also to UPDATE THE 2002 MDB FILE on Malcolm's computer  *********



D O N E prior to Mathsday 2003 : 29 May 2003

All I did was to deregister Cootamundra from the 2002 MDB and recalculate Z Scores. I updated both the 2003.mdb file with the new Z scores + I updated the Master File with the new Z Scores.

NOTE:  I did not save the 2002.mdb file with Coota Unregistered as I wanted to keep things as per the tables produced on the day in 2002.  If I ever go back and test it could get too confusing.
